# 🎬 Movie Recommender
Web application build with **Python** and **Streamlit**.
The goal was to explore some recommandation system and increase my familiarity in python

## 🔍 Functionalities
- Recommendation based on movie **genre** (content-based)
- Recommendation based on **users notes** (collaborative) with:
    - **Pearson** correlation
    - **Cosine** similarity
- Interactive interface with Streamlit

## 📁 Datas
Use the MovieLens 100k dataset ('u.data' and 'u.item')
